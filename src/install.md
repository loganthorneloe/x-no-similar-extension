# How to install

Since the extension is still under review for the Chrome web store, you'll need to install it to Chrome from your local files.

## 1. Unzip the file you downloaded.
Remember where you saved this folder to. This is the folder you'll upload.

## 2. Open your chrome based web browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
This is where we'll add it to your Chrome extensions.

## 3. In top right, toggle `Developer Mode` to on.
This allows you to add your own extensions.

## 4. In the top left, press `Load unpacked` and select the folder you unpacked.
This will add the extension to Chrome from your local files.

## 5. Voila, you're done.
Just make sure the toggle for `Remove 'See similar posts' button on X` is toggled on.
